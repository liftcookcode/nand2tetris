### In this project we built out the computer's ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit). This is responsible for performing a set of arithmetic and logical operations

#### FILES USED:
* Add16.hdl - A 16-bit adder. Adds two 16-bit two's complement values.
* ALU.hdl - The Arithmetic Logic Unit
* FullAdder.hdl - Computes the sum of three bits
* HalfAdder.hdl - Computes the sum of two bits
* Inc16.hdl - A 16-bit incrementer
