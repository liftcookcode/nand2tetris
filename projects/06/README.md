### In this project, we developed an assembler in which it translates assembly code into binary code. We trained our assembler on 4 different files.

#### FILES USED:
 * Add - Adds 2 & 3 and stores it in RAM[0]
 * Max - Computes the max value of RAM[1] and RAM[2]
 * Pong - A pong like game written in the Jack programming language
 * Rect - Draws a rectangle on the top left of the screen
 * Assembler.py - An assemlber built in python that translates assembly code into binary
