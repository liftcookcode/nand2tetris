### This is a tetris-like game built in the Jack programming language. It runs on a VM emulator desgined by Noam Nisan, Shimon Schoken, and the rest of the Nand2Tetris team at "nand2tetris.org". 

#### Secondly, all credit goes to "https://github.com/fursich". What an amazing experience to build a classic game from scratch!
