### In this project we write some low-level programs using the Hack machine language.

#### FILE USED:
* Fill - Runs an infinite loop that listens to the keyboard input. When a key is pressed (any key), the program blackens the screen. When no key is pressed, the program clears the screen and whitens the screen.
* Mult - Multiplies RAM[0] and RAM[1] and stores it in RAM[2]
